Day 5

 Had problem with exercise 1 at the end of chapter 8
	figured out that I was putting field='field' (email='[email]') instead of name='field'
	
 In section 10 figured out that one Listing 10.34 was wrong-before statement should look like this
		before(:each) do
		  @user = Factory(:user)
		end
 This will solve many problems and looks just like the statements in all of the other functions
