Having a problem with the root or home page-I have set it so that my root page is set to home.html.erb but when i go there online it does not show my homepage and instead shows the basic one that I deleted at the beginning of the project.  When I checked the route paths the root does go to the home page and the home.html.erb file has the correct html code in it.  

When I click the image to take me back to the root page it takes me to the root url but shows the old homepage that I deleted and it is deleted after I checked for it again

If you type http://localhost:3000/# then it will take you to my home page but this still leaves the problem of when you click on the home link in any other page

Put the root route at the bottom after all of the other routes and it worked-also works if you move the root route back up to the top

BIG(1) = big(0).upcase
